# RFC on the name "Cooperative Content"

A last-call before publishing any packages to get some feedback on how the current name is
interpreted.  The purpose of getting feedback is to check if there is some nebulous reason that this
name would be counter-productive to its goal; not to determine a new name.


## Rational
The naming convention for this project is currently defined as

- Project name "Cooperative Content"
- Package names
  - `coop_content`, `*_coop_content`, `coop_content_*`, `*_coop_content_*`
  - `coop-content`, `*-coop-content`, `coop-content-*`, `*-coop-content-*`

The template was purposely chosen to be `<method> <result>` or `<why/how> <what>`.  The tools
provided by this project are designed to resolve the state of information (content) by consolidating
the contributions from multiple agents (cooperation).

### Why "cooperative"?

> **cooperative** *(adjective)*
>
> 1. working or acting together willingly for a common purpose or benefit.
> 2. demonstrating a willingness to cooperate

Originally, the word "group" was used but it only communicated that there are things that have been
classed together; where "cooperative" implies a group as well as a common purpose.


### Why "content"?

> **content** *(noun)*
>
> 1. information made available by a website or other electronic medium.

The purpose of these tools is to group authors with a common goal which is realized in the form
information.  This definition of "content" brings focus to the primary result of using these tools
rather than other verbiage that would move focus to the process (eg. editing, management).


### Assumptions

- These tools will be used by Holochain developers
- The tools will be used to implement multi-agent write permissions


### Stakeholders

- Holochain Developers - *will use the name to understand the purpose of this project's products*
